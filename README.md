# KDE_SAT

Set of customizations of various utilities to look like my darling baby Saturn from [*Heaven Will Be Mine*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/836450/Heaven_Will_Be_Mine/).

## List of items and what they're for:
- [**SAT.colors**](./SAT.colors): KDE color scheme file, based on [Otto](https://store.kde.org/p/1358259)
- [**kitty_SAT.conf**](./kitty_SAT.conf): used for Kitty; place in `~/.config/kitty/themes/`.
- [**boots**](./boots): KDE Plasma 6 Splashscreens; contains four folders -- one for each combination of glitchiness and whether a background is present -- which should be downloaded and extracted into `~/.local/share/plasma/look-and-feel/`, then selected from the System Settings
