# KDE_SAT

Set of customizations of various utilities to look like my darling baby Saturn from [*Heaven Will Be Mine*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/836450/Heaven_Will_Be_Mine/).

## List of items and what they're for:
- [**SAT.colors**](./SAT.colors): KDE color scheme file, based on [Otto](https://store.kde.org/p/1358259)
- [**kitty_SAT.conf**](./kitty_SAT.conf): used for Kitty; place in `~/.config/kitty/themes/`.

Testing that this is set up!
